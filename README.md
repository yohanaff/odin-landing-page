# The Odin Project: Landing Page

This is the webpage I made to the **[Landing Page project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)** of The Odin Project.

The purpose of this project is to apply all the concepts learned in the Flexbox part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum.

Design used as a reference:

P.S. The webpage is not responsive because it's beyond the purpose of this project.

P.SÂ²: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xNcXwC6ikQ) is the tutorial I saw to do the neon button.
