# The Odin Project: Landing Page

This is the webpage I made to the **[Landing Page project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)** of The Odin Project. [Click here](https://yohanaff.github.io/odin-landing-page/) to see my finished project.

The purpose of this project is to apply all the concepts learned in the Flexbox part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum.

P.S. The webpage is not responsive because it's beyond the purpose of this project.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xNcXwC6ikQ) is the tutorial I saw to do the neon button.
